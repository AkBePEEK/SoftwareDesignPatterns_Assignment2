Task 1:

  Explanation of the SOLID principles Applied:
  
    1. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): Each payment method (such as CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, and so on) has a single responsibility: to handle its respective payment.
    2. OCP (Open/Closed Principle): The PaymentService is closed for modification but open for extension, which allows us to add additional payment methods (such as BankTransferPayment) without changing its implementation.
    3. LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle): Because the PaymentProcessor interface is implemented by all concrete classes (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, etc.), they can be used interchangeably.
    4. ISP (Interface Segregation Principle): The PaymentProcessor interface is straightforward and useful, ensuring that each payment method class implements only the processPayment method.
    5. DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle): The high-level PaymentService class is based on the PaymentProcessor interface rather than specific payment classes, ensuring flexibility and loose coupling.
